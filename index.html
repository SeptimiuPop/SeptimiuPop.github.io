								<h2 class="major">Academic Projects:</h2>

								<h3>Game Engine(C++/SFML)</h3>
								<p>As part of my final year project I dedicated my time in researching and developing an in-house game engine.  This provides a number of utilities for generating games within the 2D top-down aesthetics.  The project ended in a demonstration of a game created using the engine.</p>
								
								<h3>Data Wrangler (Java/JavaFX)</h3>
								<span><video src="resources/videos/Mappin.mp4" controls="" width="100%"></video></span>
								<p>Worked for <a href="https://mappintechnologies.com/">Mappin Technologies</a>, in a team of 9, to create a data wrangling tool for maps.</p>
								
								<h3>Chess Society (Website, LAMP stack)</h3>
								<p>This was a lab project that I worked on, with on-the-job training. It is a web application for maintaining an imaginary chess society, hosting numerous users.</p>
								
								<h3>London Property Manager (Java/JavaFX)</h3>
								<p>This was a group project, created as an application for exploring rental properties using existing data. </p>
								
								<h3>Kanban Board Manager (Java/JavaSWING)</h3>
								<p>As a team of 5 people we developed a desktop clone for Trello using agile methodologies. The app works as a kanban board, allowing users all the nececssary capabilities to create, edit and maintain task tickets. Taking after Trello, we also provided our users with data analytics for better tracking and ticket priority systems.</p>
								
								<h3>Pacman AI (Python)</h3>
								<p>Over a few diferent courses in university I had projects that involved creating smart agents that take control over the player character in order to win the game. The algorithms used involved model-based solutions like value iteration as well as model-free solutions like q-learning and SARSA. On a separate project I was also tasked with gathering data from the game and creating a classifier that can distinguishes between good and bad moves.</p>
								
								<h3>Path Searching Algorithms (Java/Processing)</h3>
								<p>As part of a robotics project I was taked with implemented various path search algorithms. The goal of this project was to guide a virtual robot to it's escape form randomly generated mazes. Some of the algorithms that I chose include A*, Bug Search and Wavefront.</p>
								
								<h2 class="major"><br> Personal Projects:</h2>

								<h3>Game Of Life (Desktop App/ C++) 
									<a href="https://github.com/SeptimiuPop/GameOfLife">code</a></h3>
									<span><video src="resources/videos/Game Of Life.mp4" controls="" width="100%"></video></span>
									<p>This was a solo project inspired by John Conway's Famous cellular automata: The Game Of Life. For this project I used C++ with the SFML library to handle the rendering. You can check out my code <a href="https://github.com/SeptimiuPop/GameOfLife">here!</a></p>
									
								<h3>Sorting Algorithms (C++/SFML)
									<a href="https://github.com/SeptimiuPop/Sorting-Algorithms">code</a></h3>
								<p>I started this project with the goal in mind to turn what could normaly be considered a boring subject in university, into a fun and interactive experience. As a result, I have created a visual interface that allows programmers to see their code sort lists in real time.</p>
								
								<h3>Prisonerâ€™s dilemma AI (Python)</h3>
								<p>Developed an autonomous agent capable of competing in a Prisoners Dilemma tournament, as part of an online competition</p>
